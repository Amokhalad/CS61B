# B-Trees

## Invariants:

because of the way B-Trees are constructed, they have two invariants:

1. All leaves are the same distance from the root.
2. A non-leaf node with k items must have exactly k + 1 children.

## 2-3 Trees

the maximum number of values a node can contain is 2, which will make a non-leaf node with 2 items have exactly 3 children (2-3 tree).

When the node gets full (has 3 items), push the middle value up to the parent and split the full node in half. This will increase the number of children the parent has. 

If the parent also gets full, repeat the process.

## 2-3-4 Trees

Similar idea to 2-3 trees but now a node can contain at most 3 values, and a non-leaf node with 3 values must have 4 children. Moreover, we push the 2nd element from the left up to the parent, and split the node where that element is.

************Question:************ What about if a node on the left branch gets full? do we push the right element from the middle up?
