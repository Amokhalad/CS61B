# Ch 25. Minimum Spanning Trees

## Minimum Spanning Trees

minimum in that its the “lightest” of edges in a graph possible, spanning in that all verticies are connected, tree in that it’s acyclic.

### Cut Property

a **cut** is an assignment of graph nodes: we assign every node in the graph to either set number one or set number to.

**crossing edge** is an edge which connects a node from one set to a node from the other set.

The ************************cut proporty is:************************ given ***any*** cut, the minimum weight crossing edge is in the MST.
