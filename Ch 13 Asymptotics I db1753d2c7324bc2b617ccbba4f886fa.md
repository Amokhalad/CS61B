## Big-Theta

Thought of as the order of growth

## Big-0

Instead of equality on the order of growth, it can be thought of as “less than or equal to”. 

So a program that has order of growth $N$,  $\Theta (N)$ , it’s Big-O can can be greater than or equal to $N$

i.e., $O(N), O(N^2),$ etc…

People sometimes prefer Big-O Instead of Big-Theta because an algorithm might be faster than the actual order of growth, i.e., it’s less than….
